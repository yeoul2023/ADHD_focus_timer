# ADHD Focus Timer

This web application is designed to help individuals with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) maintain focus during study sessions by providing a structured timer with music breaks.

## Overview

The app features a countdown timer set to a default of 15 minutes. When the timer reaches zero, the uploaded audio file plays. Once the music finishes, the timer resets and starts again, establishing a continuous cycle of focused study sessions and timed breaks.

## Key Features

- **Music Upload**: Upload an audio file from your computer. The selected music plays when the timer ends.
- **Timer Setting**: Adjust the countdown timer to your preferred duration (default is 15 minutes).
- **Start Timer**: Begin the countdown for your study session.
- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily pause the timer and music playback, then resume when youâ€™re ready.
- **Stop & Reset**: Stop both the timer and music playback, and reset the timer to the initially set duration.
- **Automatic Loop**: After the music finishes playing, the timer automatically restarts, maintaining the study-break cycle.
